# ðŸŽ® Godot FSM Practice (Finite State Machine)

This is a personal practice project to learn and implement a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** system using the Godot Engine. The goal is to create a flexible and modular movement system where behaviors like idle, run, and jump are handled as separate states.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

To explore and understand how FSMs work in game development and how they can make code more organized, reusable, and maintainable â€” especially for character movement and gameplay logic.

## âœ… What Iâ€™ve Practiced

- Building a basic FSM architecture in Godot using GDScript
- Creating clean state scripts like `Idle`, `Run`, and `Jump`
- Managing state transitions using a `StateMachine` node
- Connecting input actions to trigger state changes
- Using Godot's node and scene structure effectively
